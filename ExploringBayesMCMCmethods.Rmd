I previously determine that my data has some auto-correlation and underlying variance structures that violate the assumptions of linear regression modeling. I am now going to explore using Bayesian methods and MCMC to model my data.

This .Rmd follows Chapter 23 in "Mixed Effects Models and Extensions in Ecology with R" by Zuur et al. (2009).
