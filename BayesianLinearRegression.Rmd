#### Hypothesis #2: Explaining variation in cortisol

This model predicts that there are detectable physiologicaÃ¸ differtences between reproducing females, females newly seperated from offspring, and females who failed to reproduce

```{r}
Hyp1.data <- subset(bear.reprodata, repro!="WithMother")

 Hyp1<- inla(cortisol.kitcorrected~1+repro+N15+C13.suess+condition+year+f(
  BearID, model = "iid"
), data = Hyp1.data
  )

summary(Hyp1)
